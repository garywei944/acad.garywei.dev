My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning Systems, High Performance Computing, and AI for Science, where I leverage my mathematical and engineering talents to pioneer cutting-edge solutions.
I was a Research Assistant at [Cornell Relax ML Lab](https://relax-ml.cs.cornell.edu/) advised by [Prof. Chris De Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa/) on efficient machine learning algorithms and systems.
Grounded in mathematical principles, our work aims to expedite large-scale, high-performance machine learning systems that are efficient, parallel, and distributed in real-world settings.
Parallel to this, I collaborate on AI-driven molecule generation with talented Ph.D. students.

My academic journey has led me to a Master of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell University.
Prior to this, I pursued dual B.S. degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, complemented by a minor in Japanese.
My specialization in Mathematics focused on Applied Math and Scientific Computing.
Prior to my graduation, I engaged in research at the [UMass BioNLP Lab](https://bio-nlp.org/) under [Prof. Hong Yu](https://www.uml.edu/research/chords/faculty/yu-hong.aspx), concentrating on bio-medical and clinical NLP applications within Electronic Health Records.
